# DAUCA
## Introduction

DAUCA is a blockchain-based platform that aims to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) by implementing the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) investment strategy. Our project provides users with a simple and automated way to invest in cryptocurrencies using DCA principles. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, users can mitigate the impact of market volatility and potentially achieve better long-term investment results.

## Project Description

DAUCA  combines the power of smart contracts and decentralized exchanges to enable users to invest in cryptocurrencies using the DCA strategy. Our platform automates the investment process, allowing users to contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the current market price. This approach helps users to build a diversified portfolio over time and reduces the risk associated with timing the market. StackSafe is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and accessible to both experienced and novice investors.

## Code

The code for our StackSafe web application is available in our [Web App Repository](https://github.com/StackSafe/web-App). This repository contains the frontend and backend implementations, as well as the smart contracts that power our platform. Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute to the project, and provide feedback.
